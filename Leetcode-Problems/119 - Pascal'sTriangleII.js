*Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangl
*In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:
*
* Time Complexity: O(rowIndexÂ²) - Due to the nested loop for updating elements.
* Space Complexity: Achieved O(rowIndex) - We only store one row instead of the entire triangle.
