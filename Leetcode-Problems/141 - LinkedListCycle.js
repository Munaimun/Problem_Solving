/**
 * Detects if a linked list contains a cycle using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Uses two pointers: `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps.
 * - If there is a cycle, `fast` will eventually meet `slow`, indicating a loop.
 * - If `fast` reaches the end (`null`), there is no cycle.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N)
 * - In the worst case (when there is no cycle), `fast` traverses the entire list once, making it O(N).
 * - In the case of a cycle, `fast` moves at twice the speed of `slow`, meaning they meet within O(N) iterations.
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * - Uses only two pointers (`fast` and `slow`), so extra space usage is constant.
 *
